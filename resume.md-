### WORK HISTORY

Computational Protein / Machine Learning Engineer, [Aether Biomachines](https://www.aetherbio.com/), Menlo Park, CA [2021-Current]

* Data Science — Analyzed convoluted experimental data using Pandas grouping/merging/indexing to disclose problems in disguise; Visualized multifaceted features to share insight with cross-functional teams (R&D, automation) for planning
* Machine Learning — Built enzyme recommender systems (MolSim, RxnSim, and AtomRxn); Implemented active learning (uncertainty-based sampling, annotating unlabeled data strategy); Explored/collected sequence/structure-based features (feature engineering) with clustering; Developed activity prediction models (classification/regression) using transformer/autoencoder-based embeddings/featurizers  
* Tool Development for Enzyme Engineering — Generated combinatorial substrate analogues; Developed automatic catalytic site identification tool for AlphaFold2 structures
* Simulation/Optimization — Optimized substrate:enzyme docking structure using openMM/AmberTools (internal optimizer of AlphaFold2); Deployed end-to-end simulation tool


Postdoctoral Fellow (Computational Proteomics), [Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research](https://www.novartis.com/research-development/novartis-institutes-biomedical-research),
San Diego, CA [2012-2015]


* Structural Change Prediction Modeling — Developed Quantitative Prediction Model for Mass Spec of Biologics to
Validate/Interpret Big Data Prediction of Time-, Temperature- and pH-dependent Protein Structural Changes
* Multi-Omics Tool Development — Developed and deployed the integrated bioinformatics tool for internal
service for reconstructing antibody sequence by leveraging combined information protocol
(genomics/proteomics/informatics) and Dynamic Programming.


Postdoctoral Fellow (Computational Biophysics), [Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope](https://www.cityofhope.org/research/beckman-research-institute),
Duarte, CA [2010-2012]


* Optimized the high-dimensional biological sampling space by refinement protocol, which was enhanced by reusing the robotics locomotion algorithm used in NASA/JPL.
